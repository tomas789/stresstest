# stresstest

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or newer. All other dependencies will be installed during the installation process by PIP itself.

## Installation

You can install this package as you'd do with any other Python package. The easiest way is to use PIP.

```
pip install stresstest
```

If Python 2.x is your default Python version (check with `python --version`) you can use Python 3 specifically.

```
python3 -m pip install stresstest
```

Or you can install the package directly from source code

```
git clone https://github.com/tomas789/stresstest.git
cd stresstest
python setup.py install
```

Or let PIP do the clone for you

```
pip install git+https://github.com/tomas789/stresstest.git
```
